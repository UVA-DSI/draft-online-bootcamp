# Assignment 1: Discussion
Welcome to Technical Bootcamp! Participation is a key component to a successful online course experience. Letâ€™s start this experience by sharing something about ourselves!

To complete this discussion, follow the steps below.
In your initial post, please introduce yourself to your classmates and instructor. Then, complete the following:
* What do you do during the day (or night)? ![the bobs](https://i0.wp.com/www.itinthed.com/wp-content/uploads/whaddayado.jpg?fit=1024%2C576)
* <Question 2/Instruction 2>
* <Question 3/Instruction 3>

Respond to at least one other peer with thoughtfulness and substance. [Perhaps you have something in common you can further discuss? Or similar goals for this course? Or, perhaps you want to learn something more about what a fellow classmate shared? Ask about it!]

Tip: Use the RISE Model for Peer Feedback as a guideline for constructing your response.
